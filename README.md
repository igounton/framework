The **AI-Driven Dev Framework** is a marketplace — **skills, agents, commands, rules, prompts, templates, recipes…** — that helps you ship **high-quality features to production**.

> Orchestrate your SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) at scale, the agentic engineering way.

## 🧑‍💻 The AI-Driven Dev

Built by the [AI-Driven Dev](https://www.ai-driven-dev.fr/) community: 3 years of R&D, 500+ developers trained in English 🇬🇧 and French 🇫🇷, shipping production software with 100% AI-generated code.

- **[Join the Discord 🇫🇷](https://discord.gg/ai-driven-dev)** — public [roadmap](./ROADMAP.md) decisions every Thursday morning.
- **Want to train your team?** [See the programme](https://www.ai-driven-dev.fr/entreprise).
- **AI is important to you?** [Join the ecosystem](https://www.ai-driven-dev.fr/ecosysteme).

## ✅ Compatibility

> Primarily built on **Claude Code** (they set the standards), but compatibility with the other tools is ensured.

| Tool | Status |
| --- | --- |
| **Claude Code** | ✅ Native · **recommended** |
| **GitHub Copilot** | ✅ Supported |
| **Codex** | ✅ Supported |
| **Cursor** | ✅ Supported |
| **OpenCode** | ✅ Supported |
| **Gemini** | 🚧 In progress |
| **Mistral** | 🚧 In progress |

## 📦 Installation

Two install formats, depending on your tool:

1. **Marketplace** *(recommended)* — register once, then install and update plugins on demand. Native in Claude Code; for Copilot and Codex, grab the `-marketplace-` archive and run `aidd marketplace add`.
2. **Flat** — unzip a `-flat-` archive straight into your project (it materializes `.cursor/`, `.opencode/`, …). For tools without marketplace support.

All builds are attached to each [GitHub release](https://github.com/ai-driven-dev/framework/releases) → [latest release](https://github.com/ai-driven-dev/framework/releases/latest).

**Claude Code** — register the marketplace and install the plugins (slash commands, not shell):

```text
/plugin marketplace add ai-driven-dev/framework
/plugin install aidd-context@aidd-framework
/plugin install aidd-refine@aidd-framework
/plugin install aidd-dev@aidd-framework
/plugin install aidd-vcs@aidd-framework
/plugin install aidd-pm@aidd-framework
/plugin install aidd-orchestrator@aidd-framework
```

**Other tools** — every release attaches a per-tool archive. Grab yours from the [latest release](https://github.com/ai-driven-dev/framework/releases/latest):

<details>
<summary><strong>GitHub Copilot</strong> — marketplace</summary>

1. Download [`aidd-framework-copilot-marketplace-<version>.zip`](https://github.com/ai-driven-dev/framework/releases/latest) and unzip it.
2. Register the marketplace:
   ```bash
   aidd marketplace add aidd-framework ./aidd-framework-copilot-marketplace-<version>
   ```
3. Install the plugins from the registered `aidd-framework` marketplace (same plugin names as Claude Code).

<details>
<summary><strong>Codex</strong> — marketplace</summary>

1. Download [`aidd-framework-codex-marketplace-<version>.zip`](https://github.com/ai-driven-dev/framework/releases/latest) and unzip it.
2. Register the marketplace:
   ```bash
   aidd marketplace add aidd-framework ./aidd-framework-codex-marketplace-<version>
   ```
3. Install the plugins from the registered `aidd-framework` marketplace (same plugin names as Claude Code).

<details>
<summary><strong>Cursor</strong> — flat</summary>

1. Download [`aidd-framework-cursor-flat-<version>.zip`](https://github.com/ai-driven-dev/framework/releases/latest).
2. Unzip it into your project root — it materializes `.cursor/`, ready to use.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>OpenCode</strong> — flat</summary>

1. Download [`aidd-framework-opencode-flat-<version>.zip`](https://github.com/ai-driven-dev/framework/releases/latest).
2. Unzip it into your project root — it materializes `.opencode/`, ready to use.

## 🚀 Quick start

1. **Onboard** — one command inspects your project and guides you:
   ```text
   /aidd-context:00-onboard
   ```
2. **Run the flow** — take a feature from idea to a tested, shipped PR:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Idea(["💡 <i>'Add a dark-mode toggle'</i>"])
    Onboard["<b>/aidd-context:00-onboard</b><br/><i>understand the project</i>"]
    Brainstorm["<b>/aidd-refine:01-brainstorm</b><br/><i>clarify the request</i>"]
    Plan["<b>/aidd-dev:01-plan</b><br/><i>draft the technical plan</i>"]
    Implement["<b>/aidd-dev:02-implement</b><br/><i>write the code</i>"]
    Review["<b>/aidd-dev:05-review</b><br/><i>review the diff</i>"]
    Commit["<b>/aidd-vcs:01-commit</b><br/><i>atomic commit</i>"]
    PR(["✅ <b>/aidd-vcs:02-pull-request</b><br/><i>tested · shipped</i>"])

    Idea --> Onboard --> Brainstorm --> Plan --> Implement --> Review --> Commit --> PR

    classDef start fill:#D97757,stroke:#9c4f37,color:#fff;
    classDef done fill:#2ea043,stroke:#1a7f37,color:#fff;
    class Idea start;
    class PR done;
```

> Prefer one command for the whole loop? `/aidd-dev:00-sdlc` runs plan → implement → review → ship.

## 🧩 Plugins

Six plugins covering the whole SDLC — **install all of them**; they're designed to work together.

## 🔒 Trust & safety

Plugins can run commands, edit files, and call external services on your behalf. Before installing any plugin from any marketplace, including this one: read its `README` and `SKILL.md`, inspect its actions, and check the permissions in its hooks and MCP servers. Spot a vulnerability? Report it privately via [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md).
