## What is AI-Driven Dev?

[AI-Driven Dev](https://www.ai-driven-dev.fr/) (AIDD) is a methodology and community for shipping production-quality code with AI assistants under rigorous human supervision. Think of it as TDD/BDD for the AI era: the AI pilots the writing of code, the developer pilots the AI. This repository is the Claude Code distribution of the methodology: the skills, agents, and rules that turn the AIDD principles into actions you can invoke inside Claude Code.

## Quick start

Inside any Claude Code session, register this marketplace and install a plugin:

```text
/plugin marketplace add ai-driven-dev/aidd-framework
/plugin install aidd-dev@aidd-framework
```

That's it. The first command registers `aidd-framework` as a marketplace; the second installs the `aidd-dev` plugin from it. Repeat the `install` line for any other plugin from the catalog below.

Prefer browsing? Run `/plugin` inside Claude Code and open the **Discover** tab once the marketplace is registered.

> Using **Cursor**, **GitHub Copilot**, or **OpenCode** instead? The cross-tool adapter [`aidd-cli`](https://github.com/ai-driven-dev/aidd-cli) packages the same skills for those assistants. Setup instructions live in that repo.

## Plugins

| Plugin | Skills | What it does |
| ------ | ------ | ------------ |
| [aidd-context](plugins/aidd-context/README.md) | 7 | Project init, architecture, context generation, diagrams, learning, discovery |
| [aidd-dev](plugins/aidd-dev/README.md) | 10 | SDLC loop: plan, implement, assert, review, test, refactor, debug |
| [aidd-vcs](plugins/aidd-vcs/README.md) | 4 | Commits, pull/merge requests, release tags, issue creation |
| [aidd-pm](plugins/aidd-pm/README.md) | 4 | Ticket info, user stories, PRD, spec drafting (release candidate) |
| [aidd-orchestrator](plugins/aidd-orchestrator/README.md) | 3 | Orchestration use cases: `async-dev` (label an issue, get a PR) |
| [aidd-refine](plugins/aidd-refine/README.md) | 3 | Meta-cognition: brainstorm, challenge, condense |

Each plugin's README links to per-skill READMEs covering when to use, how to invoke, prerequisites, and outputs.

## How marketplaces work in Claude Code

A marketplace is a Git repository that publishes plugins. When you run `/plugin marketplace add <owner>/<repo>`, Claude Code clones the repo, reads its `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, and offers the plugins listed there for install. The official Anthropic documentation covers the full model:

- [Discover and install plugins](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/discover-plugins) - the user-facing flow
- [Plugin marketplaces](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces) - host your own
- [Plugins reference](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins-reference) - manifest + marketplace.json schemas
- [Anthropic's official marketplace](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-official) - canonical example

### Scopes

Plugins can be installed at three different scopes:

| Scope     | Stored in                  | Lifetime         | Best for |
| --------- | -------------------------- | ---------------- | -------- |
| `user`    | `~/.claude/plugins/`       | All your projects| Personal toolbelt |
| `project` | `.claude/settings.json` (`enabledPlugins`) in the repo | This repo only | Team-shared setup |
| `local`   | A local directory          | This machine     | Plugin development |

Set scope at install time with the `/plugin` UI, or by editing `enabledPlugins` directly in `.claude/settings.json`.

---

## Trust and safety

This is a community-maintained marketplace. Plugins can execute commands, edit files, and call external services on your behalf. Before installing any plugin from any third-party marketplace, including this one:

- Read its README and SKILL.md files.
- Inspect the action files under `actions/`.
- Check what permissions it requests in its hooks (`hooks/hooks.json`) and MCP servers (`.mcp.json`).

If you spot a vulnerability, please report it privately via [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md).

## LLM tier reference

Some skills target a specific model tier when they need a particular capability. Default tier per task type:

| Tier   | Label    | Example models           | Best for                                                          | Relative cost |
| ------ | -------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| **T1** | Fast     | Claude Haiku, Grok Fast  | Mechanical, deterministic tasks, templates, git operations        | 1x            |
| **T2** | Balanced | Claude Sonnet, GPT Codex | Implementation, structured analysis, validation, code generation  | 8x            |
| **T3** | Thinking | Claude Opus, GPT 5.2     | Deep reasoning, synthesis, planning, orchestration, onboarding    | 30x           |

## Troubleshooting

**The marketplace does not show my plugins after `/plugin marketplace add`** - run `/plugin marketplace update aidd-framework` to refresh the cache, then `/plugin` to browse the **Discover** tab.

**`/plugin install` says the plugin is unknown** - confirm the marketplace name matches the `name` field in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` of this repo (currently `aidd-framework`). The install command is `/plugin install <plugin-name>@aidd-framework`.

**My new plugin actions don't load** - run `/reload-plugins` in the same Claude Code session, or restart Claude Code if a hook config changed.
