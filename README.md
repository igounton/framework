## What is the AIDD Framework?

The **AIDD Framework** is a marketplace of **skills, agents, rules, and conventions** that make the AI-Driven Development flow concrete inside your AI coding assistant - the full SDLC (plan → implement → review → ship) under rigorous human supervision. It is the open toolset of the [AI-Driven Dev](https://www.ai-driven-dev.fr/) community.

The framework is **authored for Claude Code**, and this repository is its native marketplace. Every release **also attaches archives adapted to each tool we support** - Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Codex, OpenCode (marketplace or flat format per tool) - so you grab the build that matches your assistant. See [Another AI tool?](#another-ai-tool) for the per-tool download + install table.

---

## Prerequisites

Just an **AI coding assistant**. Everything else is per-plugin and optional.

| To… | You need |
| --- | -------- |
| Register & run the marketplace | An AI assistant - **Claude Code** runs this marketplace natively; for another tool, grab the release archive the `aidd-cli` builds for it |
| Use a plugin's extras | Only what *that* plugin's README lists - e.g. `gh` / `glab` for VCS, a ticketing tool for PM |

Nothing beyond the AI tool is required just to register the marketplace.

## Quick start

Register the marketplace and install the core plugins (Claude Code slash commands, not shell):

```text
/plugin marketplace add ai-driven-dev/framework
/plugin install aidd-context@aidd-framework
/plugin install aidd-refine@aidd-framework
/plugin install aidd-dev@aidd-framework
/plugin install aidd-vcs@aidd-framework
```

Then set up project context (guided **onboard**, or direct **project-init**) and run the dev flow:

```mermaid
---
title: AIDD quick start

flowchart TD
    Install["Marketplace + plugins installed"]
    Setup{"Set up context"}
    Onboard["aidd-context:00-onboard - guided hub"]
    Init["aidd-context:02-project-init - context engineering"]
    Brainstorm["aidd-refine:01-brainstorm"]
    Plan["aidd-dev:01-plan"]
    Implement["aidd-dev:02-implement"]
    Assert["aidd-dev:03-assert"]
    Review["aidd-dev:05-review"]
    Commit["aidd-vcs:01-commit"]
    PR["aidd-vcs:02-pull-request"]
    Learn["aidd-context:05-learn"]

    Install --> Setup
    Setup -->|guided| Onboard
    Setup -->|direct| Init
    Onboard --> Init
    Init --> Brainstorm
    Brainstorm --> Plan
    Plan --> Implement
    Implement --> Assert
    Assert --> Review
    Review --> Commit
    Commit --> PR
    PR --> Learn
```

- **New here?** Run `/aidd-context:00-onboard` - it inspects the project and guides you.
- **Whole loop in one command?** `/aidd-dev:00-sdlc` runs plan → implement → review → ship.
- **More plugins?** Browse the [catalog](#plugins) or the `/plugin` Discover tab.

### Another AI tool?

The marketplace is Claude Code native. For Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Codex, or OpenCode, each
[release](https://github.com/ai-driven-dev/framework/releases/latest) attaches a target-native
archive. Download the one for your tool, unzip it, and install per the table - then map each tier to
that tool's model via the **LLM tier reference** below.

| Tool | Download (release asset) | Install |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Claude Code** | — (native) | `/plugin marketplace add ai-driven-dev/framework` (no download needed) |
| **GitHub Copilot** | `aidd-framework-copilot-marketplace-<version>.zip` | unzip, then `aidd marketplace add aidd-framework ./aidd-framework-copilot-marketplace-<version>` |
| **Codex** | `aidd-framework-codex-marketplace-<version>.zip` | unzip, then `aidd marketplace add aidd-framework ./aidd-framework-codex-marketplace-<version>` |
| **Cursor** | `aidd-framework-cursor-flat-<version>.zip` | unzip into your project (materializes `.cursor/`) |
| **OpenCode** | `aidd-framework-opencode-flat-<version>.zip` | unzip into your project (materializes `.opencode/`) |

> Today this is **download → unzip → install** (no one-command remote fetch yet). Marketplace
> archives (`-marketplace-`) register through `aidd marketplace add`; flat archives (`-flat-`)
> materialize straight into a project workspace. A flat variant of every tool and a marketplace
> variant for Claude/Copilot/Codex are attached too - pick the format that fits your workflow.

> **Private repo?** `/plugin marketplace add` needs read access (`gh auth login` or a PAT) - see the Anthropic [install docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/discover-plugins).

## Recommended MCP servers

> **Prefer the CLI over MCP. It is more efficient.**

An MCP server loads its full tool schema into every turn. That bloats the context window and is less optimized.

A CLI call costs a few tokens. It returns only what you ask for.

Reach for MCP only when no CLI covers the service.

**Always verify your sources. Audit what you install before connecting any server.**

| Service | Official MCP | CLI alternative | Recommended |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **GitHub** | [`api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/`](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server) | [`gh`](https://cli.github.com/) | **CLI** - `gh` covers issues, PRs, releases, API at a fraction of the context |
| **Atlassian** (Jira / Confluence) | [`mcp.atlassian.com/v1/mcp`](https://www.atlassian.com/platform/remote-mcp-server) | [`acli`](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/acli/guides/introduction/) (Jira only at GA) | **CLI** for Jira · **MCP** for Confluence (no CLI yet) |
| **Playwright** | [`@playwright/mcp`](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp) | [`npx playwright`](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-cli) + [official skill](https://claude.com/plugins/playwright) | **CLI** - the CLI drives a real browser (`playwright open`, `codegen`, `--headed`). The skill wraps it |
| **Figma** | [`mcp.figma.com/mcp`](https://developers.figma.com/docs/figma-mcp-server/remote-server-installation/) | none for design data | **MCP** |
| **Notion** | [`mcp.notion.com/mcp`](https://developers.notion.com/guides/mcp/get-started-with-mcp) | none official | **MCP** |

## How marketplaces work in Claude Code

A marketplace is a Git repository that publishes plugins. When you run `/plugin marketplace add <owner>/<repo>`, Claude Code clones the repo, reads its `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, and offers the plugins listed there for install.

`aidd-framework` is a **community-maintained, methodology-driven complement** to Anthropic's [official marketplace](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-official). The official catalog covers broadly useful plugins curated by Anthropic; AIDD ships plugins that materialise a specific way of working (the AI-Driven Development flow) inside Claude Code. The two are designed to coexist; you can register both and install plugins from either.

The official Anthropic documentation covers the full model:

- [Discover and install plugins](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/discover-plugins) - the user-facing flow
- [Plugin marketplaces](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces) - host your own
- [Plugins reference](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins-reference) - manifest + marketplace.json schemas
- [Anthropic's official marketplace](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-official) - canonical example

### Scopes

Plugins can be installed at three different scopes:

| Scope     | Stored in                  | Lifetime         | Best for |
| --------- | -------------------------- | ---------------- | -------- |
| `user`    | `~/.claude/plugins/`       | All your projects| Personal toolbelt |
| `project` | `.claude/settings.json` (`enabledPlugins`) in the repo | This repo only | Team-shared setup |
| `local`   | A local directory          | This machine     | Plugin development |

Set scope at install time with the `/plugin` UI, or by editing `enabledPlugins` directly in `.claude/settings.json`.

---

## Versioning and updates

- Each plugin versions independently via `release-please`. Tags look like `aidd-<plugin>-vX.Y.Z`.
- The root marketplace (`marketplace.json`) versions independently as `vX.Y.Z`.
- Pull updates inside Claude Code with `/plugin marketplace update aidd-framework`.

See [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md) for the full history.

---

## Trust and safety

This is a community-maintained marketplace. Plugins can execute commands, edit files, and call external services on your behalf. Before installing any plugin from any third-party marketplace, including this one:

- Read its README and SKILL.md files.
- Inspect the action files under `actions/`.
- Check what permissions it requests in its hooks (`hooks/hooks.json`) and MCP servers (`.mcp.json`).

If you spot a vulnerability, please report it privately via [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md).

<details>
<summary><strong>LLM tier reference</strong> (used by skills that target a specific model tier)</summary>

Some skills target a model **tier** when they need a particular capability. The framework is authored against Claude; on another AI tool, map each tier to that tool's nearest model.

| Tier | Best for | Claude | Other tools (examples) |
| ---- | -------- | ------ | ---------------------- |
| **T1 Fast** | Mechanical, deterministic tasks, templates, git ops | Haiku 4.5 | GPT-5.5 mini, Gemini Flash, Grok fast |
| **T2 Balanced** | Implementation, validation, code generation | Sonnet 4.6 | GPT-5.5, Gemini Pro |
| **T3 Thinking** | Deep reasoning, synthesis, planning, onboarding | Opus 4.8 | GPT-5.5 (thinking), Gemini Pro thinking |

</details>

## Troubleshooting

Install issues, load problems, and the framework's current limits → [`docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

---

## Contributing

Everyone can shape this project. **Anyone** can open issues, react, and upvote ideas in [Discussions](https://github.com/ai-driven-dev/framework/discussions) (a signal); a counted roadmap vote is a benefit of **Core Team** membership in the [AIDD](https://www.ai-driven-dev.fr/) programme (training/community/coaching) and up, and **pull-request rights** are held by [Certifié and Habilité contributors](./GOVERNANCE.md#roles) so the standard stays consistent. See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for the contribution flow, the commit scope discipline, and the templates each surface (skill, agent, rule, command) follows, and [`GOVERNANCE.md`](./GOVERNANCE.md) for the roles and how decisions get made.

To build and ship a brand-new plugin through this marketplace, see [`docs/CREATE_PLUGIN.md`](docs/CREATE_PLUGIN.md).

By participating you agree to the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
