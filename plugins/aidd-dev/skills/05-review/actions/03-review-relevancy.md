# 03 - Review Relevancy

Judge whether the diff belongs, coherent with the codebase, its conventions and declared rules, serving the real need, with nothing duplicated or over-built, and record the misfits in the review report.

## Input

The diff to review (a git ref range or path; defaults to `git diff main`), the need it serves (the plan objective or the ticket), and the project's declared rules and conventions, discovered at runtime.

## Output

The `Relevancy` section of the feature folder's `review.md`, filled with misfit findings under the lenses `fit`, `conform`, and `rot`, each tied to evidence.

## Process

1. **Gather.** Resolve the diff from `$ARGUMENTS`, otherwise `git diff main`. Capture the need from the plan objective or the ticket. Discover the project's declared rules and conventions at runtime, never hardcoded. Fall back cleanly when a source is absent.
2. **Fit.** Check the change against the need: does it serve the actual intent end to end, or only the literal criteria? Flag any drift between intent and result.
3. **Conform.** Check the change against the declared rules and the surrounding conventions. Flag each violation with the rule or pattern it breaks.
4. **Rot.** Scan for duplication (an existing helper reinvented), over-engineering (speculative generality, unused abstraction), and incoherence (naming, docs versus code). Cite the site.
5. **Record.** Write each finding into the `Relevancy` section of `review.md`, rated and placed under its lens per `@../references/review-rubric.md`. A bare opinion is not a finding: tie each to a declared rule, a duplication site, an over-engineering smell, or a named need-gap. Describe the fix, never patch.

## Test

- The `Relevancy` section of `review.md` is filled, every finding under a lens and tied to a `file:line`, a declared rule, a duplication site, or a named need-gap.
- No finding is a bare opinion, and no code is patched.
