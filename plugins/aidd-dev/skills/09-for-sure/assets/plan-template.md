<!--  AI INSTRUCTIONS ONLY -- Follow those rules, do not output them.

- ENGLISH ONLY
- Text is straight to the point, no emojis, no style, use bullet points.
- Replace placeholders (`{variables}`) with actual user inputs.
- Define flow of the feature, from start to end.
- Interpret comments on this file to help you fill it.
- Each phase MUST have acceptance criteria.
- During implementation, the AI may amend this plan. Every AI change MUST be prefixed with 🤖 and include a brief rationale.
- This file IS the live tracking file for For Sure. Filename status: `<task>.pending.md` → `.in-progress.md` → `.done.md`.
- `success_condition` MUST be a runnable command. The loop renames to `.done.md` only when it passes.
- Log is APPEND-ONLY. One entry per step attempt. Never rewrite history.

### Files to modify

- `path/to/file.ts` - {one-line reason}

### Files to create

- `path/to/new-file.ts` - {one-line purpose}

### Files to delete

## Rules to apply

<!-- Rules selected from the canonical `aidd_docs/rules/` inventory at plan time. These are the rules this task must follow; the reviewer verifies the implementation against them. `none` if the project has no rules. -->

| Name   | Path                                  | Why it applies |

## Risk register

<!-- Top technical risks that could derail implementation. Identify them upfront so the plan accounts for them. -->

| Risk     | Impact                        | Mitigation                            |
| -------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |

## Implementation phases

### Phase {n}: {name}

> {straight to point goal}

#### Tasks

1. {ultra concise task1, with logical ordering}
2. {...}
3. {...}

#### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] {verifiable boolean condition 1}
- [ ] {verifiable boolean condition 2}

## Amendments

<!-- AI-initiated changes during implementation. Each entry is prefixed with 🤖. -->

## Log

<!-- APPEND ONLY. One entry per step attempt. Never rewrite. -->
<!-- ### #N - YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ -->
<!-- > step - what worker tried -->
<!-- = ✓|✗ verification result (orchestrator-checked, not worker-claimed) -->
<!-- → next step or RETRY: why -->

## Validation flow demonstration

<!-- A short demo showing the feature works end-to-end, what a REAL user would do to 100% validate the feature. -->
