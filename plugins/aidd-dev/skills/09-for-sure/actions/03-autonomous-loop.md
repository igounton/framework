# SA-03: Autonomous orchestrator

Orchestrates the loop. For each unchecked step: spawns a worker agent, verifies the result, checks the box or retries. One step = one agent = one log entry. Never does the work itself.

## Orchestrator prompt

```
Autonomous orchestrator. No human interaction.

FILE: `aidd_docs/tasks/<task-name>.in-progress.md`

LOOP — for each unchecked step:

1. Read entire file — frontmatter, journey map, steps, full Log
2. Increment `iteration` in frontmatter
3. Read Log — learn from prior attempts
4. Find next unchecked step
5. Spawn a WORKER agent for that step with this prompt:

   "Execute this step. Auto-accept everything — act as the user, make every
   decision yourself (approve prompts, generate keys, install tools, click
   buttons). Signing in via existing accounts (Google, GitHub, SSO) is allowed
   — it uses the user's active browser session. Just do it.
   Report exactly what you did and the concrete result.

   STEP: <step description>
   CONTEXT: <relevant info from file — objective, rules, prior Log entries for this step>"

6. Read the worker's result
7. VERIFY concretely — run a check command, read a file, test the output. Don't trust the worker's claim.
8. If verified ✓ → check the step `[x]`, append Log entry
9. If NOT verified ✗ → append Log entry with why, spawn another worker with the error context
10. Move to next unchecked step

AFTER all steps checked:
11. Run success_condition command — verify yourself
12. If TRUE → rename to .done.md, stop
13. If FALSE → add new steps to address root cause, continue loop
```

## Worker prompt template

```
Execute this step. Auto-accept everything — act as the user, make every
decision yourself (approve prompts, generate keys, install tools, click
buttons). Do not ask for permission. Just do it.

Signing in via existing accounts (Google Sign-in, GitHub OAuth, SSO) is NOT
account creation — it uses the user's active browser session. Do it.

STEP: <step description>
CONTEXT: <from tracking file>

Report:
- What you did (specific: commands, files, URLs)
- The concrete result (paste output, screenshot, evidence)
```

## Log entry format

One entry per step attempt:

```
### #<N> — <timestamp>
> <step name> — <what worker tried>
= <✓|✗> <verification result — what orchestrator checked>
→ <next step or RETRY: why>
```

## Test policy

- **Assertion**: Each step attempt produces exactly one Log entry. Checked steps have verified results.
- **Exit condition**: All steps `[x]` AND success_condition verified by command → `.done.md`.
- **Expected result**: Updated task file with one log entry per step.
- **On failure**: Log the failure, spawn new worker with error context. Never stop unless success_condition is met.
