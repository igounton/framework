### `.claude-plugin`

| File |
|------|
| [plugin.json](.claude-plugin/plugin.json) |

### `agents`

| File | Description |
|------|---|
| [implementer.md](agents/implementer.md) | `Milestone executor. Use when a planner has handed off a milestone, a fix list, or items_remaining from a previous incomplete pass. Codes, tests, repairs. Returns what's done, what's remaining, and a completion score. Never replans, never judges.` |
| [planner.md](agents/planner.md) | `Planning agent. Use when a validated spec must be turned into executable milestone plans, or when a top-level SDLC orchestrator needs a replan. Writes plans and decisions only. Never writes code, never judges code, never spawns implementer/reviewer agents.` |
| [reviewer.md](agents/reviewer.md) | `Independent critic in fresh context. Use when an artifact (code, spec, plan, doc) needs verification against a validator (acceptance criteria, checklist file, or any explicit ruleset). Returns reviewed items, findings, completion score and quality score. Never edits the artifact, never decides what to do next.` |

Use when a human (or Gardener) needs to take a free-form request from idea to shipped code, end-to-end. Coordinates spec generation, planning, implementation, review, and shipping by composing other skills and agents. Supports two modes - `auto` (default, no human interaction) and `interactive` (pauses for human confirmation at key gates). Holds no business logic of its own; every step is delegated.` |
