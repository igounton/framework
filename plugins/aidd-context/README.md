Knowledge production plugin for the AI-Driven Development framework.

> Status: stable.

First time? Install with `/plugin install aidd-context@aidd-framework`, then run `aidd-context:00:onboard`.

Covers project bootstrap, project initialisation, context generation, Mermaid diagrams, learning, discovery, and a state-aware onboarding loop.

| [1.0]      | [onboard](skills/00-onboard/README.md)                 | Detect the project's aidd-context state and guide the user to ONE next aidd-context action through a state -> recommend -> execute loop.                       |
| [1.1]      | [bootstrap](skills/01-bootstrap/README.md)             | Imagine and validate the technical architecture of a new SaaS through interactive Q&A, candidate-stack comparison, multi-agent audit, and an INSTALL.md output. |
| [1.2]      | [project-init](skills/02-project-init/README.md)       | Initialize the project memory bank (rule directories are created lazily by `03-context-generate`).                                                              |
| [1.3]      | [context-generate](skills/03-context-generate/README.md) | Generate Claude Code context artifacts - router-based skills, agents, and rules.                                                                                |
| [1.4]      | [mermaid](skills/04-mermaid/README.md)                 | Generate high-quality Mermaid diagrams from markdown content using a structured plan-validate workflow.                                                         |
| [1.5]      | [learn](skills/05-learn/README.md)                     | Capture and store learnings from recently implemented features into memory bank, decisions, or coding rules.                                                    |
| [1.6]      | [discovery](skills/06-discovery/README.md)             | Help users discover installed skills and find the right one for their use case.                                                                                 |

## Onboarding

New to aidd-context, or unsure what to run next? Invoke `aidd-context:00:onboard`. The skill:

1. Probes the filesystem (no questions) to snapshot what already exists - `aidd_docs/`, memory bank, rules skeleton, the `<aidd_project_memory>` block in your AI context file.
2. Picks ONE next aidd-context skill from the state matrix and presents a 5-option numbered menu (run / explain / handoff / swap / stop).
3. Loops back to detection after each execution so the recommendation always reflects current state.

The onboard skill is scoped to aidd-context only. Cross-plugin global walkthroughs live elsewhere in the framework.
