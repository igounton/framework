description: Generate and maintain router-based Claude Code skills — SKILL.md router + atomic testable actions + TDD evaluations. Use when the user wants to create a new skill, refactor an existing skill, add or remove actions, or migrate a slash command into a skill. Do NOT use for editing a single action inside an existing skill (edit directly), creating slash commands (no router needed), writing MCP servers, or modifying project-level CLAUDE.md files.

# Generate Skill

Produces Claude Code skills following a router-based architecture: SKILL.md as pure router, actions as atomic testable operations, evaluations written BEFORE implementation (strict TDD).

## Available actions

| #   | Action              | Role                                                | Input              |
| --- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| 01  | `capture-intent`    | Clarify output + decide generate vs modify          | user intent        |
| 02  | `design-evals`      | Write the 3 scenarios (should/should_not/ambiguous) | expected output    |
| 03  | `decompose-actions` | List actions + their tests                          | evals + output     |
| 04  | `draft-skill`       | Write SKILL.md router                               | decomposed actions |
| 05  | `write-actions`     | Write each action file                              | validated SKILL.md |
| 06  | `validate`          | Run evals, fix loop                                 | complete skill     |

## Default flow (strict TDD)

`01 → ✅ → 02 → ✅ → 03 → ✅ → 04 → ✅ → 05 → ✅ → 06`. No skipping allowed. The `✅` is mandatory: after each action runs, execute its `## Test` (R13) before moving to the next. A failing test blocks the flow until fixed.

## Modify flow

`01` (detects modify) → `✅` → `03` (re-decompose if structure changes) → `✅` → `05` (targeted edit) → `✅` → `06` (re-validate). Same gate after every step.

## Level-1 rules (non-negotiable)

### Structure
- **R1** — SKILL.md is a pure router: description + action table + transversal rules. Zero business logic.
- **R2** — One skill = one domain (tool OR activity). Actions are the domain's operations.
- **R3** — References one-level deep only. Never chain reference → reference.
- **R4** — SKILL.md ≤ 500 lines. If exceeded, split into references.

### Naming
- **R5** — Tool domain = singular noun (`slack`, `notion`, `github`). Activity domain = action verb (`review`, `plan`, `test`).
- **R6** — Description must include: (a) what, (b) explicit triggers, (c) a "Do NOT use for..." clause. Format constraints (third person, char caps, reserved words) live in `references/naming-conventions.md` — single source.

### Data
- **R7** — Zero duplication. Data lives in the broadest scope possible: cross-skill → shared repo folder; skill-specific → `<skill>/assets/` or `<skill>/references/`. No copies; references point.
- **R8** — Two-role split:
  - `references/` = **documents to READ** (conventions, decision guides, cheatsheets, API notes) — knowledge consumed by the agent to reason correctly.
  - `assets/` = **templates to COPY or data to INJECT** at runtime (skeletons, JSON templates, ID tables, prompt fragments) — raw material consumed by actions.
  - Heuristic: a file that only explains *how things work* → `references/`. A file that is *copied or injected as-is* → `assets/`.

### Test & evaluation
- **R9** — Every action has a `## Test` with a concrete verification — the sine qua non. Pick the form pragmatically: a JS script in `scripts/` when the check is deterministic (parseable / on-disk); an MCP runbook when the verification needs an external system ("verify Slack post via `mcp__slack__slack_get_channel_history`"); an LLM assertion with a concrete example when neither fits. What matters is that a verification actually runs.
- **R10** — Every skill has `evals/scenarios.json` with ≥ 3 `should`, ≥ 3 `should_not`, ≥ 1 `ambiguous`.
- **R11** — Strict TDD: output → evals → action tests → SKILL.md → actions. Never the reverse.

### Execution
- **R12** — When writing a script is the right choice (R9), use JavaScript (Node) — avoid Python unless a JS equivalent is impractical. Default to the built-in `node:test` runner with `node:assert/strict` and `node:child_process` — zero-dep, runs with `node --test path/to/test-*.js`. Reach for vitest/jest/mocha only when `node:test` is genuinely insufficient. "Solve, don't punt": scripts handle their own errors and print actionable diagnostics.
- **R13** — Test gate after every action. After running any action, immediately execute its `## Test` (the JS script, MCP runbook, or LLM assertion declared by R9) and confirm pass before proceeding to the next action. A failing test blocks the flow — fix the action's output, re-run the test, then continue. This rule applies at runtime in every flow that uses this skill, including the generation flow itself (`01 → ✅ → 02 → ✅ → …`).

### Portability and concision
- **R14** — No hardcoded repo-specific paths in `assets/` or `references/`. Templates declare structure; runtime fills content. A skill must drop into any repo without edits to its own files. If an asset needs sample paths, the action that consumes it is responsible for deriving them from the actual filesystem at runtime.
- **R15** — Less is more. Every file in a skill (SKILL.md, actions, references, assets, README) must be ruthlessly trimmed. No restating, no warm-up paragraphs, no hedging. Every line that survives must earn its tokens — they will be loaded into a model's context on every relevant turn for the lifetime of the skill.

## Actions

```markdown
@actions/01-capture-intent.md
@actions/02-design-evals.md
@actions/03-decompose-actions.md
@actions/04-draft-skill.md
@actions/05-write-actions.md
@actions/06-validate.md
@actions/rules/01-generate-rules.md
@actions/agents/01-generate-agent.md
```

## References (documents to read)

- `references/naming-conventions.md` — tool vs activity naming rules, hard constraints
- `references/skill-vs-command.md` — decision guide: skill vs slash command vs hook

## Assets (templates to copy)

- `assets/skill-template.md` — SKILL.md skeleton to copy and fill
- `assets/action-template.md` — action file skeleton to copy and fill
- `assets/evals-template.md` — `scenarios.json` structure and concrete example

## Invocation

All validator invocations in this skill assume the working directory is the **repository root** (the directory that contains `.claude/`). The canonical form is:

```bash
node <path-to-this-skill>/scripts/validate-all.js <path-to-target-skill>
```

The target path can be relative to cwd or absolute. Each validator script also accepts no argument — it then defaults to the generate-skill directory itself (self-validation).

## Distribution

- **Version, license, author**: declared in the frontmatter above.
- **Status**: stable, self-validating, portable.
- **Dependencies**: Node.js ≥ 18 (the validator scripts use no external packages).
- **Usage by other teams**: copy the `context-generate/` folder into your skill directory. The skill makes no organization-specific assumptions — every doctrine reference in a generated skill is a placeholder you fill in with paths from your own repo.
