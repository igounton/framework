# 03 - Seed first skill

Generate one starter skill inside the new plugin by delegating to the skill-generation flow.

## Inputs

- `plugin_name` (required) - from action 01.
- `seed_skill.name` (optional) - from action 01.
- `seed_skill.description` (optional) - from action 01.
- `<plugins-root>/<plugin_name>/skills/` directory created by action 02.

## Outputs

```yaml
seed_skill_path: <plugins-root>/<plugin_name>/skills/01-<seed_skill.name>/
seed_skill_status: created | skipped
```

## Depends on

- `02-scaffold-tree`

## Process

1. Self-skip when `seed_skill.name` is empty. Set `seed_skill_status = skipped` and return.
2. Set working location to `<plugins-root>/<plugin_name>/skills/` with skill prefix pinned to `01-`.
3. Run the skill-generation flow against that location, in order, passing `skill_name = seed_skill.name` and `expected_output = seed_skill.description`:
   - `@../skills/01-capture-intent.md`
   - `@../skills/02-decompose-actions.md`
   - `@../skills/03-draft-skill.md`
   - `@../skills/04-write-actions.md`
   - `@../skills/05-validate.md`
4. Each upstream action's `## Test` must pass before the next is invoked, per the skill flow's own contract.
5. Record `seed_skill_status = created` once `@../skills/05-validate.md` returns a green table.

## Test

```bash
# Test: when a seed skill was created, its SKILL.md exists and starts with YAML frontmatter
# (when skipped, seed_skill_status=skipped and no 01-* dir is present - no file to check)
if [ "${seed_skill_status}" = "created" ]; then
  test -f "${seed_skill_path}/SKILL.md" || exit 1
  head -1 "${seed_skill_path}/SKILL.md" | grep -q "^---$" || exit 1
fi
echo ok
```
