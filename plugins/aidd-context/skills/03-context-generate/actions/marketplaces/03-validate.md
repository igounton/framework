# 03 - Validate marketplace

Run validation checks and install-time invariants before the marketplace is shared, per confirmed tool.

## Inputs

- `marketplace_files` (required) - from `@01-init-marketplace.md`.
- `confirmed_tools`, `blocked_tools` (from `@01-init-marketplace.md`).

## Outputs

```yaml
validation_status: pass | fail
per_tool:
  - tool: <id>
    status: pass | fail | blocked
    findings:
      - path: <file>
        severity: error | warning
        rule: <rule id>
        detail: <one-line>
    install_smoke:
      added: true | false
      installed_plugins:
        - <plugin_name>: ok | failed
```

## Depends on

- `01-init-marketplace`
- `02-add-plugin-entry` (at least one entry must be present per tool, otherwise skip install smoke and surface a warning)

## Validation commands per tool

Resolve each tool's validator command and no-validator fallback from the **Plugin and marketplace validator commands** table in `@../../references/ai-mapping.md`. Marketplace file paths come from the hooks/plugins/marketplaces map and required keys + reserved-name list from `@../../references/marketplace.md`. Do not hardcode tool specifics here.

## Process

For each confirmed (non-blocked) tool:

1. **Schema check.** For each confirmed (non-blocked) tool, resolve its validator command (or no-validator fallback) from the **Plugin and marketplace validator commands** table in `@../../references/ai-mapping.md`. Run the validator when available; otherwise JSON-parse the marketplace file and check that all required keys per `@../../references/ai-mapping.md` are present and non-empty. Map every error/warning into `findings[]`. Block on any `error` severity.
2. **Reserved-name check.** Reload the marketplace JSON and re-confirm `name` is not on the reserved list in `@../../references/marketplace.md`.
3. **Source-shape check** (shape rules: `@../../references/marketplace.md`):
   - relative path -> directory exists, contains the tool's expected manifest file, no `..` segments.
   - `github` -> `repo` is `owner/name` shape; `sha` (if present) is 40 hex chars.
   - `url` / `git-subdir` -> `url` is a valid git URL; `git-subdir` has a non-empty `path`.
   - `npm` -> `package` non-empty.
4. **Cross-source duplicates.** No two entries share `plugin_name`.
5. **Local install smoke (Claude Code only).** When safe (clean working tree, user opt-in), run:
   - `claude plugin marketplace add <repo-root>`
   - `claude plugin install <first-plugin>@<marketplace_name>`
   - Record success/failure per plugin in `install_smoke.installed_plugins`.
   - Always remove the test marketplace afterwards: `claude plugin marketplace remove <marketplace_name>`.
6. Set `validation_status = pass` iff all confirmed tools produced no `error` findings AND (smoke skipped OR every Claude Code install reported `ok`).

## Test

`validation_status == pass`; for Claude Code with at least one entry, `install_smoke.added == true` and every `installed_plugins` entry is `ok` (or explicitly skipped with a logged warning); for all no-validator tools, marketplace files parse as valid JSON with required keys present per `@../../references/ai-mapping.md`; each D2-blocked tool has `status: blocked`.
