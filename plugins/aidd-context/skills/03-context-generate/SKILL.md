model: opus
description: Generate context artifacts (skills, agents, rules, commands, hooks, plugins, marketplaces) across the host AI tool(s) the project uses. Use when the user wants to create, refactor, add or remove actions in a skill, migrate a legacy slash command into a router-based skill, or generate a new agent, rule, command, hook, plugin, or marketplace. Do NOT use for editing a single action inside an existing skill (edit directly), writing MCP servers, or modifying project-level files.

# Context Generate

Generates the seven context artifacts a project consumes, with per-tool path resolution.

- **Skills** - router-based: `SKILL.md` router + atomic testable actions.
- **Agents** - single-file agent definitions following the framework's agent template.
- **Rules** - framework rule files governing editor/agent behavior.
- **Commands** - flat `.md` slash command files (frontmatter + body), for one-shot manual triggers.
- **Hooks** - JSON / TOML entries (or a JS/TS plugin module for OpenCode) bound to lifecycle events.
- **Plugins** - full plugin scaffold (a plugin manifest + README + slot dirs, path resolved per tool from `@references/ai-mapping.md`; optional seed skill).
- **Marketplaces** - a marketplace catalog file (path resolved per tool from `@references/ai-mapping.md`) that distributes one or more plugins.

## Sub-flows

Each artifact type has its own sub-flow under `@actions/<sub-domain>/`. All sub-flows are equal-weight siblings; pick the one matching the user's artifact type.

| Sub-domain     | Actions count | Entry action                                                             | Flow type           |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| `skills`       | 5             | `@actions/skills/01-capture-intent.md`                                   | sequential 01..05   |
| `agents`       | 1             | `@actions/agents/01-generate-agent.md`                                   | single action       |
| `rules`        | 1             | `@actions/rules/01-generate-rules.md`                                    | single action       |
| `commands`     | 1             | `@actions/commands/01-generate-command.md`                               | single action       |
| `hooks`        | 1             | `@actions/hooks/01-generate-hook.md`                                     | single action       |
| `plugins`      | 4             | `@actions/plugins/01-capture-plugin-intent.md`                           | sequential 01..04   |
| `marketplaces` | 3             | `@actions/marketplaces/01-init-marketplace.md`                           | sequential 01..03   |

## Default flow

For sequential sub-flows, run actions in order. After each action, run its `## Test` before moving to the next.

## Modify flow

`01` of the matching sub-flow (detects modify) → re-decompose or re-edit as needed → final validate action of that sub-flow.

Gate exception: in modify mode the target tool is fixed by the existing artifact's on-disk location. Skip detect, propose, confirm, and D2.

## Runtime tracking

Materialize the sub-flow as a task list at skill entry; a task closes only when its `## Test` passes.

## Transversal rules

- Writes are CWD-relative; the plugin install root is for reading templates only, never for prefixing a write target.
- Skills sub-flow applies R1-R9 from `references/skill-authoring.md` to every generated skill. Other sub-flows follow their own conventions in `assets/` and `references/`.
- R10 - Tool resolution gate (generate-only): detect, propose, confirm 1..N, then look up `references/ai-mapping.md` per (artifact, tool); block unsupported pairs (D2) and continue the rest. Skip the gate in modify mode (tool fixed by the existing artifact's on-disk location). Procedure: `references/tool-resolution.md`.
