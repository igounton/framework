Silently inspects the project, the AIDD setup, and which AIDD plugins are installed, then adapts the menu to that context. Use when the user says "where do I start", "onboard me", "onboard me to this project", "what should I run next", "what should I work on next", "what's the state of this project", "guide me through aidd", "guide me through aidd-context", or invokes `aidd-context:00-onboard`. Do NOT use to enumerate every installed surface from raw user intent (the discovery skill in this plugin handles that).` |

Stack-agnostic - every build action reads `INSTALL.md` and names no technology. Architecture-100% / business-0%: never writes business logic. Use when starting a new project, choosing a stack, or standing up the running skeleton. Do NOT use to add features to an existing project or to write business logic.` |
