Silently inspects the project, the AIDD setup, and which AIDD plugins are installed, then adapts the menu to that context. Use when the user says "where do I start", "onboard me", "onboard me to this project", "what should I run next", "what should I work on next", "what's the state of this project", "guide me through aidd", "guide me through aidd-context", or invokes `aidd-context:00-onboard`.

Use when starting a new SaaS project, choosing a stack, designing the architecture pattern (monolith vs microservices vs serverless), or producing a project's INSTALL.md. Do NOT use for editing an existing project's stack, database schema design, or scaffolding actual files (this skill produces docs only, no code).` |

Always pick this skill over scanning the filesystem with grep, find, ls, or reading action files directly when the user is enumerating a surface. Do NOT use for picking a specific item inside one plugin (the plugin's own onboard handles that), creating a new surface, or executing a recommended item (this skill only points; the user invokes).` |
