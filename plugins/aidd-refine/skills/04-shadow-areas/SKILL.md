description: Scan a markdown artifact (idea, user stories, PRD, spec) for blind spots and emit a structured shadow report grouped by category and sorted by severity. Use to find gaps, missing parts, or what's missing in a written artifact; not for interactive Q&A (use aidd-refine:01-brainstorm) or code review.

# Shadow Areas

Analytically scans a written artifact for gaps the author has not addressed. Unlike iterative Q&A clarification, this skill reads the existing material and emits a structured report: each gap carries a category from a locked 7-category taxonomy, a 3-tier severity, and a direct-question probe the author can act on immediately.

## Actions

| #   | Action           | Role                                                                     | Input                                    |
| --- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| 01  | `detect`         | Parse input, extract gaps, classify category and severity, emit probes   | file path or inline text                 |
| 02  | `render-report`  | Render markdown grouped by category and sorted by severity, write report | gap list from detect                     |
| 03  | `diff`           | Load prior report, classify gaps as closed / still-open / newly-introduced | gap list from detect + prior report path |

## Default flow

Router dispatches by context:

- No prior report present: `01-detect` then `02-render-report`
- Prior report present: `01-detect` then `03-diff` then `02-render-report`

The `02-render-report` action always runs last and writes `<source>-shadow-report.md` next to the source.

## Transversal rules

- Never modify the source artifact.
- Every gap carries all three: a category, a severity, and a probe question.
- Every probe is a direct question ending with `?`.
- Categories and severities come from the locked sets in `references/locked-sets.json`.
- When zero blockers and zero majors remain, stamp the report `status: clean`.
- On re-runs, gaps are matched by category and snippet, never by question wording, so rephrasing a question never creates a spurious "newly introduced" gap.
