# 05 -- Delegate SDLC

Hands the implementation off to the SDLC capability. The orchestrator picks the branch name and the PR contract; the SDLC owns code, tests, push, and PR creation. The orchestrator only verifies the contract was honoured.

## Inputs

- `issue` (required) -- the locked issue object
- `run_id` (required) -- run identifier from `03-acquire-lock`
- `discovered_skill` (required) -- skill name returned by `04-check-sdlc`
- `config` (required) -- parsed `.claude/aidd-orchestrator.json`

## Outputs

```json
{
  "branch": "feat/issue-<n>-<slug>",
  "pr_number": 117,
  "pr_url": "https://github.com/org/repo/pull/117",
  "tests_passed": true,
  "duration_seconds": 612,
  "default_branch_head_before": "<sha>",
  "default_branch_head_after": "<sha>",
  "default_branch_advanced": false
}
```

## Depends on

- `04-check-sdlc`

## Process

1. Record the default-branch SHA: `git fetch origin && BEFORE=$(git rev-parse origin/<default>)`. Contract baseline.
2. Compute the feature branch name: `feat/issue-<issue.number>-<kebab-slug-of-title>` (truncate slug to 40 chars). Must not equal the default branch.
3. Compose the delegation prompt with these explicit, non-negotiable constraints (state at the top AND repeat at the bottom):

   ```
   You are implementing GitHub issue #<n>: "<title>".

   Constraints:
   - Work on a new branch named exactly: feat/issue-<n>-<slug>.
     Create it from origin/<default>: git checkout -B feat/issue-<n>-<slug> origin/<default>.
   - Do NOT make commits on <default>. Do NOT --force on <default>. Do NOT merge anything.
   - Run the project's test command before opening the PR; tests must pass.
   - Push the branch: git push -u origin feat/issue-<n>-<slug>.
   - Open a Pull Request:
       title: "feat: <title> (#<n>)"
       base:  <default>
       head:  feat/issue-<n>-<slug>
       body:  must contain "Closes #<n>" so GitHub auto-links the issue.
     Use `gh pr create --base <default> --head feat/issue-<n>-<slug> --title "..." --body "..."`.
   - Return a structured result with: { branch, pr_number, pr_url, tests_passed, commit_shas[] }.

   Issue body and labels follow.
   <issue body>
   <issue labels>
   ```

4. Invoke the skill named in `discovered_skill` via the `Skill` tool with that prompt. Read the skill name from input; never hardcode.
5. Capture the SDLC result. If the SDLC did not return a `pr_number`, query the API: `gh pr list --repo <owner>/<repo> --head feat/issue-<n>-<slug> --state open --json number,url --jq '.[0]'`.
6. **Verify the contract** (the SDLC could have ignored instructions):
   - `AFTER=$(git fetch origin && git rev-parse origin/<default>)`.
   - **No commits on default**: if `AFTER != BEFORE`, the SDLC pushed to `<default>`. Recover:
     - Cherry-pick `$BEFORE..$AFTER` onto `feat/issue-<n>-<slug>`, push.
     - `git revert --no-edit $BEFORE..$AFTER` on `<default>`, push.
     - Set `default_branch_advanced = true`. The audit comment names the offending SHAs.
   - **PR exists**: if no PR was returned and none can be found via the API, mark the run failed and route to `06-write-audit` as a contract violation.
   - **PR shape**: assert `headRefName == feat/issue-<n>-<slug>`, `baseRefName == <default>`, body contains `Closes #<n>`. If any field is wrong, post a comment on the PR with the contract violation and let the human fix it; the run still succeeds (PR exists; the lifecycle continues).
7. Forward the structured result to `06-write-audit`. Do not transition labels here; that happens in `06`.

## Test

Clean delegation: `default_branch_advanced == false`, `gh pr view <pr_number>` returns a PR with `headRefName == feat/issue-<n>-<slug>`, `baseRefName == <default>`, body contains `Closes #<n>`. `git log origin/<default>` does NOT contain bot commits for this run id.

Violation: SDLC pushed to default. Action recovers commits onto the feature branch, reverts on default, opens (or recovers) the PR, and emits `default_branch_advanced == true` so `06-write-audit` flags the violation.
