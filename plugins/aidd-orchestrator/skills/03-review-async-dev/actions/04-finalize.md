# 04 -- Finalize

Closes the loop after a stop decision: tags the audit record, posts a structured summary comment, and updates the Check Run.

## Inputs

- `pr_number` (required) -- integer
- `stop_reason` (required) -- one of `max_iterations`, `blocked_label`, `human_reviewer`
- `iteration_log` (required) -- accumulated entries written by `03-fix-iteration`
- `trigger_comment_id` (optional) -- id of the comment that triggered the loop

## Outputs

```json
{
  "audit_path": "aidd_docs/async-runs/2026_05/2026-05-07T10-12-31Z-i42.json",
  "check_run_conclusion": "neutral",
  "summary_comment_url": "https://github.com/org/repo/pull/117#issuecomment-..."
}
```

## Depends on

- `02-detect-stop` (only when its `decision == "stop"`)

## Process

1. Open the existing audit record. Append `{ "loop_closed_at": "<ISO8601>", "stop_reason": "<reason>", "iterations": iteration_log }`.
2. Update the GitHub Check Run for the run id: `conclusion = "success"` if `stop_reason == "human_reviewer"` and last iteration tests passed, else `"neutral"` for `max_iterations` and `"action_required"` for `blocked_label`.
3. Render the summary body from the template below; substitute every placeholder. Empty sections must be omitted, never left blank.
4. Post the summary as a single PR comment via `gh pr comment <pr> --repo <owner>/<repo> --body-file -`.
5. If `trigger_comment_id` is set, ensure a final reaction is set on the trigger comment: `+1` for success, `confused` for `max_iterations`, `-1` for `blocked_label`. Remove any prior `eyes` reaction first.
6. Transition labels on the linked issue (`gh pr view <pr> --json closingIssuesReferences`):
   - On `human_reviewer` (success): remove `config.labels.working`, add `config.labels.awaiting_review`.
   - On `max_iterations`: remove `config.labels.working`, add `config.labels.awaiting_review` (PR exists, human must look).
   - On `blocked_label`: remove `config.labels.working`, add `config.labels.blocked`.

## Summary template

The body is markdown and must follow this exact structure:

```markdown
## Async review summary

**Stop reason** -- `<stop_reason>` (`<one-line plain English explanation>`)
**Iterations** -- `<count>` of `<max_iterations>` allowed
**Last commit** -- [`<short_sha>`](<commit_url>)
**Tests** -- `<pass>/<total>` passing on the last iteration

### Iterations

| # | Comments addressed | Commit | Tests |
| - | ------------------ | ------ | ----- |
| 1 | <count> ([list](#)) | [`<sha>`](<url>) | `<pass>/<total>` |
| 2 | <count> ([list](#)) | [`<sha>`](<url>) | `<pass>/<total>` |

### Comments addressed in iteration <last>

- [`path:line`](<comment_url>) -- "<original comment body, truncated to 80 chars>" -> <one-line fix summary>

### Next step

- `human_reviewer` -- A reviewer has commented since the last automated push. The loop is paused. To continue, address the comments and re-trigger with `<retry mention>` or `<retry label>`.
- `max_iterations` -- The maximum of `<max_iterations>` automatic iterations was reached without convergence. Human review is required before another retry.
- `blocked_label` -- The `<blocked label>` label is set. Remove it once the blocker is resolved to allow another retry.

---
*Audit log: `<audit_path>`.*
```

The summary stays under ~30 lines on a typical PR. Truncate quoted comment bodies to 80 characters with `...`. Iterations table has one row per iteration; if no fix iterations ran, show only the header row plus a `_no fix iterations on this loop_` note.

## Test

Given an audit record with two `fix-iteration` entries and `stop_reason = human_reviewer`: after this action runs, the audit JSON contains `loop_closed_at` and `stop_reason`, the Check Run conclusion is `success`, the trigger comment carries a `+1` reaction, and a PR comment exists whose body matches the template (contains the `## Async review summary` heading, an `Iterations` table with two data rows, a `Next step` section with the `human_reviewer` bullet, and an `Audit log` footer).
