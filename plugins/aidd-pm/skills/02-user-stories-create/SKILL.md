## Default flow

Single action skill. The router dispatches to `create-user-stories` whenever a story-generation phrase appears.

## Transversal rules

- **INVEST**: each story is Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable.
- **Definition of Ready**: acceptance criteria, dependencies, story points, and zero blocking questions before save.
- **Lean clarification**: at most 3 questions per iteration; focus on user needs, not technical aspects.
- Stories are sorted by implementation priority.
- Always wait for explicit user validation before saving to the tracker.
- The save target is the configured ticketing tool from project memory.
