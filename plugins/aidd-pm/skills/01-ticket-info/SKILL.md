## Default flow

Single action skill. The router dispatches to `ticket-info` whenever a ticket-lookup phrase appears.

## Transversal rules

- Read the configured ticketing tool from project memory first; otherwise inspect repo configuration or environment.
- Auto-detect the ticket identifier from the current branch name when none is provided.
- Format the identifier per project convention before querying.
- Read-only: never create, comment, transition, or reassign from this skill.
