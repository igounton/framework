# 04 - Spec

Generates or refines the immutable contract between human intent and the
downstream agents that will plan, implement, and review the work. The spec
is what a planner consumes; it stays free of implementation detail and is
locked once validated.

## When to use

- "draft spec", "spec for X", "generate spec from prd".
- "refine the spec" when reviewer findings come back.
- Invoking `/spec`.
- When an orchestrator needs a normalized contract before triggering a plan.

## When NOT to use

- To write source code.
- To draft a full PRD → use `03-prd`.
- To modify a spec that has already been validated and locked - the spec
  is immutable past that point; open a new spec instead.

## How to invoke

Build a fresh spec from a request or an existing PRD:

```
Use skill aidd-pm:04:spec build for <request or PRD path>
```

Refine an existing spec from reviewer findings:

```
Use skill aidd-pm:04:spec refine on <spec path> with <findings>
```

The router picks the action from the inputs: presence of `existing_spec`
and `findings` triggers `refine`; otherwise `build` runs.

## Outputs

- A spec file structured per [`assets/spec-template.md`](assets/spec-template.md),
  with explicit non-goals, bulleted acceptance criteria, and `TBD: <precise
  question>` markers wherever information is missing.
- On `refine`: the same file rewritten to address the supplied findings.
- The skill never self-validates; the caller spawns a reviewer using
  [`assets/spec-validator.yml`](assets/spec-validator.yml) and feeds the
  findings back through `refine` for the next iteration.

## Prerequisites

- A free-form request, an existing PRD path, or an existing spec plus a
  set of reviewer findings.
- Write access to the spec target path in the current repo.

## Technical details

See [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md) for the action contract,
[`actions/01-build.md`](actions/01-build.md) and
[`actions/02-refine.md`](actions/02-refine.md) for the two atomic actions,
and [`assets/`](assets/) for the canonical template plus the validator
checklist used by reviewers.
