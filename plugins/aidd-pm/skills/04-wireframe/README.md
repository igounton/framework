# 04 - Wireframe

Turns product requirements into low-fidelity wireframes: a screen inventory,
ASCII layouts with component hierarchies, and a Mermaid navigation flow.
Stays at the structure level; never visual design and never code.

## When to use

- "wireframe", "wireframes", "wireframe the feature".
- "screen layout", "low-fi mockup", "maquette fil de fer".
- When you need to lay out the screens and navigation of a feature, with or
  without an existing PRD.
- At any stage, including a legacy project with no product docs, to capture
  or redesign existing screens.

## When NOT to use

- For high-fidelity visual design (colors, typography, polished mockups).
- To generate UI code (HTML, CSS, components) - that belongs to your dev
  capability.
- To draft a PRD → use `03-prd`.
- To write a spec → use `05-spec`.

## How to invoke

```
Use skill aidd-pm:04-wireframe for <feature to wireframe>
```

The skill auto-loads a related PRD from `aidd_docs/` when one exists, proposes
a screen inventory and screen types for you to confirm or challenge, then
drafts each screen per template, shows the draft, and waits for explicit
validation before saving. No document is required to start.

## Outputs

- A wireframe file saved at
  `aidd_docs/tasks/<yyyy_mm>/<yyyy_mm_dd>-<feature_name>-wireframe.md`.
- Sections: screen inventory, layouts, component hierarchy, navigation
  flow (Mermaid), states and annotations, responsive notes, open questions.
- No executable code and no tracker mutations.

## Prerequisites

- A feature to wireframe. A PRD is optional; it is auto-loaded from
  `aidd_docs/` when present.
- Write access to `aidd_docs/tasks/` in the current repo.

## Technical details

See [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md) for the action contract,
[`actions/01-wireframe.md`](actions/01-wireframe.md) for the single atomic
action, [`assets/wireframe-template.md`](assets/wireframe-template.md) for
the wireframe structure, and
[`assets/wireframe-validator.yml`](assets/wireframe-validator.yml) for the
checklist a caller's reviewer uses to validate the result.
