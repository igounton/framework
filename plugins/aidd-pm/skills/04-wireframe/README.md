# 04 - Wireframe

Turns product requirements into low-fidelity wireframes: a screen inventory,
ASCII layouts with component hierarchies, and a Mermaid navigation flow.
Stays at the structure level; never visual design and never code.

## When to use

- "wireframe", "wireframes", "wireframe the feature".
- "screen layout", "low-fi mockup", "maquette fil de fer".
- When a PRD is ready and you need to lay out the screens and navigation
  before writing the spec.

## When NOT to use

- For high-fidelity visual design (colors, typography, polished mockups).
- To generate UI code (HTML, CSS, components) - that belongs to your dev
  capability.
- To draft a PRD → use `03-prd`.
- To write a spec → use `05-spec`.

## How to invoke

```
Use skill aidd-pm:04-wireframe for <PRD path or feature description>
```

The skill parses the input, drafts each screen per template, shows the
draft, and waits for explicit validation before saving.

## Outputs

- A wireframe file saved at
  `aidd_docs/tasks/<yyyy_mm>/<yyyy_mm_dd>-<feature_name>-wireframe.md`.
- Sections: screen inventory, layouts, component hierarchy, navigation
  flow (Mermaid), states and annotations, responsive notes, open questions.
- No executable code and no tracker mutations.

## Prerequisites

- A PRD path, a feature description, or both.
- Write access to `aidd_docs/tasks/` in the current repo.
