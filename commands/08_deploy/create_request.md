# Create Request Prompt

Fill a PR/MR template with recent changes in the current branch and create a request with it.

## Rules

- Use `git` and the VCS tool configured.
- Read instructions from the template and fill it.
- Use the `git log` commands to get the recent changes IF NOT PROVIDED.
- Do not commit anything, nor create new branches.
- Ask for user validation before creating the request.
- **CRITICAL: Detect the base branch correctly**
  - DO NOT assume it's `main` or `master`
  - Common base branches: `develop`, `main`, `master`, `staging`
