# Goal

Assert that this feature works as intended.

## Resources

### Coding assertions

Based on the current context, use relevant coding assertions to validate correctness.

```markdown
@{{DOCS}}/aidd_docs/memory/coding_assertions.md
```

## Rules

- Do not stop until the feature works as intended.

## Steps

Iterate over those steps until the feature work as intended.

1. For each assertion, fix any issues preventing it from passing.
2. After fixing, re-run this assertion to confirm it passes.
3. Once all assertions pass, re-run all the checks again to ensure every assertion is passing.
