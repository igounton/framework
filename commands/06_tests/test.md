# Test Iterator Prompt

## Goal

Identify untested behaviors in the feature, then create and iterate on tests until they pass with modern testing best practices.

## Context

- Current project testing framework and conventions
- Test coverage and quality metrics

### Testing rules

```markdown
@{{TOOLS}}/rules/
```

## Rules

- Focus on ONE test at a time
- Apply current testing best practices
- Continue iterating until test passes AND meets quality criteria
- Never compromise on test quality for speed
- Focus on functional aspects only, ignore technical details

## Process steps

1. List untested behaviors in the target area
   1. Think about behaviors to test based on existing ones
   2. Determine a score, 0: not needed, 5: critical core flow to test
   3. Group them by distinct sections
   4. Prioritize based on score and impact
   5. Display organized minimal bullet list of untested behaviors
2. Pick the highest-priority untested behavior
3. Generate initial test with best practices
4. Run test and capture results
   1. If test fails: analyze failure, improve test, repeat from step 4
   2. If test passes: validate against quality checklist
   3. If quality insufficient: improve test quality, repeat from step 4
5. Move to next untested behavior, repeat from step 2
