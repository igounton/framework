# Contribution Guide - AIDD Framework

This guide explains how to contribute to the AIDD framework - the source of truth for agents, commands, rules, skills, and templates.

> **Looking for the wider AIDD community guidelines** (roles, governance, training programme)? They live at [ai-driven-dev.fr](https://www.ai-driven-dev.fr/). The org-wide contribution surface is internal; this file is sufficient for contributing to this repository on its own.

## Development setup

To contribute changes locally you need:

- **Git** and a GitHub account with access to this repository.
- **Node 20+** and **pnpm** (workspace scripts and the lefthook installer rely on pnpm). Verify with `node --version` and `pnpm --version`.
- **jq** for JSON validity checks in the pre-commit hook (`brew install jq` on macOS).
- **python3** for YAML validity checks in the pre-commit hook (default on macOS and most Linux distributions).
- **pipx** for JSON-Schema validation of plugin/marketplace/settings files (`brew install pipx` on macOS). The hook calls `pipx run check-jsonschema`; the tool is fetched and cached automatically on first run, so no global install is required beyond pipx itself.
- **Optional**: the `gh` CLI authenticated if you want to test plugin install flows or open PRs from the terminal.

Once the dependencies above are in place, install hooks once per clone:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm exec lefthook install
```

After that, every commit will run the framework-local checks (json/yaml validity, schema validation on the three Claude Code surfaces, SKILL.md frontmatter, per-plugin CATALOG.md regeneration, commitlint).

Verify your environment any time with `./scripts/doctor.sh` (`user`, `contributor`, or `all`); it reports a colour-coded OK / WARN / FAIL per check and exits non-zero on critical failures. The canonical issue and PR label list lives in [`.github/labels.yml`](./.github/labels.yml); the [`validate`](./.github/workflows/validate.yml) workflow runs the same lefthook hooks against the full tree on every push and pull request, so contributions that bypass the local hooks are still gated by the same checks.

## Releases

This repository follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) with automated releases via [Release Please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please).

| Commit type                   | Version bump | Example       |
| ----------------------------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| `fix:`                        | Patch        | 3.0.0 → 3.0.1 |
| `feat:`                       | Minor        | 3.0.0 → 3.1.0 |
| `feat!:` / `BREAKING CHANGE:` | Major        | 3.0.0 → 4.0.0 |

**How it works:**

1. Every push to `main` with conventional commits triggers a **Release PR** (changelog + version bump)
2. When the Release PR is merged → GitHub Release + tag + downloadable tarball

The tarball contains only the framework content: `plugins/`, `.claude-plugin/`, `aidd_docs/`.

## Commit scope discipline

Every commit must use one of the five allowed scopes:

| Scope               | Use for                                                              |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `aidd-context`      | Changes inside `plugins/aidd-context/`                               |
| `aidd-dev`          | Changes inside `plugins/aidd-dev/`                                   |
| `aidd-vcs`          | Changes inside `plugins/aidd-vcs/`                                   |
| `aidd-pm`           | Changes inside `plugins/aidd-pm/`                                    |
| `aidd-orchestrator` | Changes inside `plugins/aidd-orchestrator/`                          |
| `aidd-refine`       | Changes inside `plugins/aidd-refine/`                                |
| `marketplace`       | Changes to `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (catalog metadata only) |
| `framework`         | Root-level changes: build scripts, CI, configs, docs, `aidd_docs/`   |

Examples:

```bash
git commit -m "feat(aidd-dev): add for-sure skill"
git commit -m "fix(aidd-vcs): correct commit template"
git commit -m "docs(framework): update README for plugin model"
git commit -m "build(framework): regenerate catalogs"
```

Cross-plugin changes must be split into separate commits, one per scope.

---

## Commit conventions

This repository uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) to automate versioning and changelog generation via [Release Please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please).

**Every commit message must follow this format:**

```text
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

| Type       | Purpose                                             | Version bump | Changelog |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | --------- |
| `feat`     | New feature (agent, command, rule, skill, template) | Minor        | ✅        |
| `fix`      | Bug fix or correction                               | Patch        | ✅        |
| `perf`     | Performance improvement                             | Patch        | ✅        |
| `revert`   | Revert a previous commit                            | Patch        | ✅        |
| `docs`     | Documentation, templates                            | None         | ✅        |
| `refactor` | Restructuring without behavior change               | None         | ✅        |
| `style`    | Formatting, whitespace                              | None         | -         |
| `test`     | Adding or updating tests                            | None         | -         |
| `build`    | Build system or external dependencies               | None         | -         |
| `ci`       | CI/CD configuration                                 | None         | -         |
| `chore`    | Maintenance, tooling                                | None         | -         |

**Breaking changes:** add `!` after any type to trigger a **major** version bump (e.g., `feat!:`, `fix!:`, `refactor!:`). Use this when renaming files, removing content, or changing structure in a way that breaks existing setups.

**Examples:**

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add new debug command"
git commit -m "fix: correct placeholder syntax in plan command"
git commit -m "docs: update contribution guide"
git commit -m "refactor!: rename agents/ directory structure"
```

> PR titles are also validated against this convention. A PR with an invalid title will fail the `lint-pr` check.

---

## Contribution process

Every change requires a **Pull Request** with a conventional commit title (see above). PRs are squash-merged using the PR title as the commit message.

Changes impact all teams using the framework and must be reviewed before merge.

---

## Existing patterns

When adding or modifying content, follow the existing patterns used across the marketplace:

| Content | Reference example | Notes |
| ------- | ----------------- | ----- |
| Plugin  | [`plugins/aidd-refine/`](plugins/aidd-refine/) | Minimal three-skill plugin with stable status. |
| Skill   | [`plugins/aidd-context/skills/00-onboard/`](plugins/aidd-context/skills/00-onboard/) | Router-based skill with SKILL.md, actions/, and README. |
| Agent   | [`plugins/aidd-dev/agents/`](plugins/aidd-dev/agents/) | Frontmatter-driven agent definitions. |
| Rule    | [`.claude/rules/`](.claude/rules/) (project-local) | Frontmatter `paths` plus a short body. |

For a step-by-step walk-through of building a brand-new plugin, see [`docs/CREATE_PLUGIN.md`](docs/CREATE_PLUGIN.md).

---

## Syntax and conventions

The framework must remain **tool-agnostic** - the CLI handles all syntactic adaptation at install time.

> **IMPORTANT**: Source files use **Claude Code** syntax by default (`/command`, `@path`).

### Frontmatter and metadata

All framework elements use YAML frontmatter. Some properties are universal, others are specific to certain tools.

| Property        | Used by                 | Supported everywhere |
| --------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------- |
| `name`          | agents, commands        | yes                  |
| `description`   | agents, commands, rules | yes                  |
| `argument-hint` | commands                | yes                  |
| `model`         | agents, commands        | no                   |
| `color`         | agents                  | no                   |
| `docs`          | agents                  | no                   |
| `globs`         | rules                   | no                   |
| `alwaysApply`   | rules                   | no                   |
| `paths`         | rules                   | no                   |

> Properties marked **no** can be added but will not be interpreted by all target tools. See documentation for each tool for details.

---

## CLI and installation

The CLI manages the full installation lifecycle: tool selection, generation of adapted copies, file integrity tracking via hashes in `.aidd/config.yml`, and update management.

When you contribute new content to the framework, the CLI will automatically detect it and generate the appropriate copies for each installed tool on the next update.

---

## Reporting issues

**[Create an issue](https://github.com/ai-driven-dev/aidd-framework/issues/new/choose)** using the templates:

- 🐛 **Bug Report** - incorrect content, broken syntax, missing field
- ✨ **Feature Request** - new rule, skill, command, agent, or IDE mapping

Issues are automatically added to the [AIDD - Produit](https://github.com/orgs/ai-driven-dev/projects/7) project board.

---

## Commit Scope Rules

The commit scope drives release-please's per-package version bumps in this monorepo. Each plugin versions independently; `marketplace.json` tracks the root (`.`) version.

| Scope | Package path | Released tag pattern | What bumps |
|---|---|---|---|
| `aidd-context` | `plugins/aidd-context` | `aidd-context-vX.Y.Z` | Plugin only |
| `aidd-dev` | `plugins/aidd-dev` | `aidd-dev-vX.Y.Z` | Plugin only |
| `aidd-vcs` | `plugins/aidd-vcs` | `aidd-vcs-vX.Y.Z` | Plugin only |
| `aidd-pm` | `plugins/aidd-pm` | `aidd-pm-vX.Y.Z` | Plugin only (currently pinned to `1.0.0-rc.1`) |
| `aidd-orchestrator` | `plugins/aidd-orchestrator` | `aidd-orchestrator-vX.Y.Z` | Plugin only |
| `aidd-refine` | `plugins/aidd-refine` | `aidd-refine-vX.Y.Z` | Plugin only |
| `framework` or `marketplace` | `.` (root) | `vX.Y.Z` | `marketplace.json` via `extra-files` |

`commitlint.config.cjs` enforces these scopes. Root releases attach `aidd-framework-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz` and per-tool bundles; plugin releases attach only `<plugin>-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz`.
