# Create User Stories

## Goal

Generate well-structured user stories from PRD features, organized by epic, through systematic Product Owner questioning.

## Rules

- No technical aspect, focus on user needs
- Requirements started from $ARGUMENTS
- Lean, concise approach
- 3 max questions per iteration
- Sort by implementation priority
- All checklists must be satisfied

### INVEST Checklist

- [ ] **I**ndependent — can be developed without other stories
- [ ] **N**egotiable — details can be discussed
- [ ] **V**aluable — delivers value to the user
- [ ] **E**stimable — team can estimate the effort
- [ ] **S**mall — fits in a single sprint
- [ ] **T**estable — acceptance criteria are verifiable

### Definition of Ready

- [ ] Acceptance criteria defined (Gherkin format)
- [ ] Dependencies identified
- [ ] Story points estimated (Fibonacci: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13)
- [ ] No blocking questions
- [ ] Story assigned to an epic

### Definition of Done (project-level)

Stories must also satisfy the project's Definition of Done. Reference the DoD template for the full checklist:

- [ ] Acceptance criteria pass
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployable to staging

```

### Step 1: Identify Epics from PRD

**Do:**

1. Read the PRD and extract the major functional blocks
2. Map each block to an epic using the scope 3 tiers (MVP / Next Release / Never)
3. For each epic, justify its contribution to the North Star Metric
4. Format each epic using the epic template

**Success criteria:** All PRD features mapped to epics, scope tier assigned, NSM justification documented

### Step 2: Write Stories per Epic

**Do:**

1. Read the template from Resources. Follow its exact structure — same headings, same table columns, same formats. Do not add, remove, or rename sections.
2. For each epic (starting with MVP), ask clarifying questions (3 max per iteration)
3. Write stories in canonical format: "As a [persona], I want [action] so that [benefit]"
4. Add Gherkin acceptance criteria (happy path + error + boundary)
5. Estimate each story in Fibonacci (1, 2, 3, 5, 8) — flag any story > 8 for splitting
6. Validate each story against INVEST checklist and Definition of Ready

**Success criteria:** All stories pass INVEST checklist and Definition of Ready

### Step 3: Define Project DoD

**Do:**

1. Define the project-level Definition of Done using the DoD template
2. Include standard criteria (acceptance criteria pass, code review, tests, documentation, deployable)
3. Add project-specific criteria if needed
4. Document exceptions (spike, prototype)

**Success criteria:** DoD defined and applicable to all stories

### Step 4: Challenge Gate

**Do:**

1. Read the template from Resources
2. Verify every template section exists in the output with the exact same heading name and no section was added beyond what the template defines
3. Verify format requirements:
   - Stories in "As a [persona], I want [action] so that [benefit]" format
   - Acceptance criteria in Given/When/Then Gherkin format
   - Estimation in Fibonacci (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13)

**Success criteria:** All template sections present and format requirements met. If any section is missing or any format is wrong, STOP — fix it. Do NOT proceed until structurally complete.

### Step 5: Save

**Do:**

1. Save epics and stories to the ticketing system

**Success criteria:** Epics and stories saved and accessible
