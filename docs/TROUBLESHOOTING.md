# Troubleshooting

Common issues when installing or running the AIDD marketplace, plus the current limits of the framework.

## Install and load

### The marketplace doesn't show my plugins after `/plugin marketplace add`

Refresh the cache: `/plugin marketplace update aidd-framework`, then open `/plugin` → **Discover**.

### `/plugin install` says the plugin is unknown

The marketplace name must match the `name` field in this repo's `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (currently `aidd-framework`). Install with `/plugin install <plugin-name>@aidd-framework`.

### A private repo won't add as a marketplace

`/plugin marketplace add <owner>/<repo>` needs read access to the repo - authenticate with `gh auth login` or a PAT on the machine running your AI tool.

### My new plugin's actions don't load

Run `/reload-plugins` in the same session, or restart the tool if a hook config changed.

## Limitations (what AIDD does not do)

- **Not autonomous by default.** Skills run under human supervision; you drive each step.
- **Authored for Claude Code.** Other tools get a per-release archive built by the `aidd-cli` (download → unzip → install; see [Another AI tool?](../README.md#another-ai-tool)); native parity is a roadmap item, not a guarantee today.
- **Plugins assume their own context.** A skill that expects a git repo, a `package.json`, or a ticketing tool will not work without it - check the plugin's README.
- **No hosted service.** AIDD is prompt content you install into your own tool; there is no AIDD server, account, or telemetry.
