# ❓ FAQ & Troubleshooting

Most "how do I…" answers live in the README; this page covers what isn't documented elsewhere, plus common install issues and the framework's limits.

## 📦 Install, update, other tools

- **Install / first run** → [Quick start](../README.md#-quick-start).
- **Update plugins** → `/plugin marketplace update aidd-framework`, or see [Versioning & updates](MARKETPLACE.md#-versioning--updates).
- **Private repo?** Yes — `/plugin marketplace add` just needs GitHub read access (via `gh auth login` or a PAT).
- **Cursor / Copilot / Codex / OpenCode?** Each other tool installs via its own native mechanism (project files, local plugins, or a plugin command) from the [release](https://github.com/ai-driven-dev/framework/releases/latest) archives. Steps per tool → [Other tools](../README.md#other-tools).

## 💸 Cost and quotas

- **Does running plugins cost money?** The plugins are MIT-licensed and free; the Claude calls they make consume your Anthropic plan or API balance (per-invocation on a plan, per-token on an API key).
- **Disable a plugin without uninstalling?** Run `/plugin` and toggle it off in the **Installed** tab, or remove its entry from `.claude/settings.json` `enabledPlugins` (project scope) or `~/.claude/plugins/` (user scope).

## 🔒 Security

- **What can a plugin do? Is it safe?** → [Trust and safety](../README.md#-trust-and-safety) and [`SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md). Plugins run commands, edit files, and call services through your AI tool — inspect a plugin's `actions/`, `hooks/hooks.json`, and `.mcp.json` before installing. Claude Code asks before tool calls by default.
- **Report a vulnerability** → [`SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md) (GitHub Security Advisories; never a public issue).

## 🤝 Contributing

- **Write your own plugin** → [`CREATE_PLUGIN.md`](CREATE_PLUGIN.md).
- **File a bug / request a feature** → [issue templates](https://github.com/ai-driven-dev/framework/issues/new/choose).
- **Community** → [Discord](https://discord.gg/EWySJSpjWs) · [website](https://www.ai-driven-dev.fr/) (more in the [README](../README.md#-the-ai-driven-dev)).

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

- **Marketplace doesn't show my plugins after `/plugin marketplace add`** — refresh the cache: `/plugin marketplace update aidd-framework`, then open `/plugin` → **Discover**.
- **`/plugin install` says the plugin is unknown** — the marketplace name must match the `name` in this repo's `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (`aidd-framework`). Install with `/plugin install <plugin-name>@aidd-framework`.
- **A private repo won't add as a marketplace** — `/plugin marketplace add` needs read access; authenticate with `gh auth login` or a PAT on the machine running your AI tool.
- **My new plugin's actions don't load** — run `/reload-plugins` in the same session, or restart the tool if a hook config changed.

## 🚧 Limitations (what AIDD does not do)

- **Not autonomous by default.** Skills run under human supervision; you drive each step.
- **Authored for Claude Code.** Other tools install via their native mechanism from the release archives ([Other tools](../README.md#other-tools)); public-marketplace publishing is on the way, native parity is a roadmap item.
- **Plugins assume their own context.** A skill that expects a git repo, a `package.json`, or a ticketing tool won't work without it — check the plugin's README.
- **No hosted service.** AIDD is prompt content you install into your own tool; there is no AIDD server, account, or telemetry.
