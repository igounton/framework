## aidd-context

Knowledge production plugin for the AI-Driven Development framework.

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [`aidd-context:00:onboard`](../plugins/aidd-context/skills/00-onboard/README.md) | Detect the project's aidd-context state and guide the user to one concrete next aidd-context action through a state -> recommend -> execute loop. Use when the user says "where do I start", "I'm new to this plugin", "onboard me", "what should I run next", "guide me through aidd-context", or invokes `aidd-context:00:onboard`. Do NOT use to enumerate every installed skill from raw user intent (a dedicated discovery skill in this plugin handles that), and do NOT use to teach the global cross-plugin AIDD flow (a separate cross-plugin onboard owns that scope). |
| [`aidd-context:01:bootstrap`](../plugins/aidd-context/skills/01-bootstrap/README.md) | Imagine and validate the technical architecture of a new SaaS through interactive Q&A, candidate-stack comparison, multi-agent audit, and an INSTALL.md output. Use when starting a new SaaS project, choosing a stack, designing the architecture pattern (monolith vs microservices vs serverless), or producing a project's INSTALL.md. Do NOT use for editing an existing project's stack, database schema design, or scaffolding actual files (this skill produces docs only, no code). |
| [`aidd-context:02:project-init`](../plugins/aidd-context/skills/02-project-init/README.md) | Initialize or refresh the project memory bank and ensure AI context files contain the project memory block. Use when running `aidd init` for the first time, bootstrapping a new project, or re-running the init flow on an existing project. Do NOT use for updating individual memory files after they exist - use `aidd-context:05:learn` instead; do NOT use for editing a single rule - edit the file directly. |
| [`aidd-context:03:context-generate`](../plugins/aidd-context/skills/03-context-generate/README.md) | Generate Claude Code context artifacts - skills (router-based: SKILL.md + atomic testable actions + minimal evals), agents, and rules. Use when the user wants to create, refactor, add or remove actions in a skill, migrate a slash command into a skill, or generate a new agent or rule. Do NOT use for editing a single action inside an existing skill (edit directly), creating slash commands (no router needed), writing MCP servers, or modifying project-level CLAUDE.md files. |
| [`aidd-context:04:mermaid`](../plugins/aidd-context/skills/04-mermaid/README.md) | Generate high-quality Mermaid diagrams from markdown content using a structured plan-validate workflow. |
| [`aidd-context:05:learn`](../plugins/aidd-context/skills/05-learn/README.md) | Capture and store project-level learnings, conventions, and decisions surfaced during work into memory, decisions, or rules. Use proactively when the user states a durable project rule or convention ("for next", "always do X", "from now on", "going forward", "rule:", "convention:"), records a technical decision and its rationale, deprecates something, or notes an insight that should outlive the current task. Do NOT use for personal or AI-preference reminders (those belong to user memory), routine code edits, minor fixes, or anything already captured. |
| [`aidd-context:06:discovery`](../plugins/aidd-context/skills/06-discovery/README.md) | Enumerate installed surfaces of the AI tool (skills, agents, commands, plugins, MCP servers, rules, hooks, memory files) and recommend the best match for the user's stated intent. Use proactively whenever the user asks the model to list, show, enumerate, find, or pick among any of these surfaces - including imperative phrasings ("list hooks", "show me the rules", "enumerate skills", "find a memory file", "which agent reviews code"), question phrasings ("what's available?", "what hooks do we have?", "which rule applies here?", "what memory files do we have?"), and indirect phrasings ("what can I use for X?", "do we have something that does Y?"). Always pick this skill over scanning the filesystem with grep, find, ls, or reading action files directly when the user is enumerating a surface. Do NOT use for picking a specific item inside one plugin (the plugin's own onboard handles that), creating a new surface, or executing a recommended item (this skill only points; the user invokes). |

## aidd-dev

Code transformation plugin for the AI-Driven Development framework.

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [`aidd-dev:00:sdlc`](../plugins/aidd-dev/skills/00-sdlc/README.md) | Pure orchestrator for the full AIDD development flow. Use when a human (or Gardener) needs to take a free-form request from idea to shipped code, end-to-end. Coordinates spec generation, planning, implementation, review, and shipping by composing other skills and agents. Supports two modes - `auto` (default, no human interaction) and `interactive` (pauses for human confirmation at key gates). Holds no business logic of its own; every step is delegated. |
| [`aidd-dev:01:plan`](../plugins/aidd-dev/skills/01-plan/README.md) | Generate technical implementation plans, define component behaviors, and extract design details from images. |
| [`aidd-dev:02:implement`](../plugins/aidd-dev/skills/02-implement/README.md) | Execute an implementation plan phase by phase via the implementer agent, iterating until 100% completeness. |
| [`aidd-dev:03:assert`](../plugins/aidd-dev/skills/03-assert/README.md) | Assert features work as intended - general assertions, architecture conformance, and frontend UI validation. |
| [`aidd-dev:04:audit`](../plugins/aidd-dev/skills/04-audit/README.md) | Perform deep codebase analysis to identify technical debt, dead code, and improvement opportunities. |
| [`aidd-dev:05:review`](../plugins/aidd-dev/skills/05-review/README.md) | Review code quality against project rules and validate feature behavior against plan specifications. |
| [`aidd-dev:06:test`](../plugins/aidd-dev/skills/06-test/README.md) | Write and iterate on tests until they pass, and validate user journeys end-to-end in the browser. |
| [`aidd-dev:07:refactor`](../plugins/aidd-dev/skills/07-refactor/README.md) | Optimize code for performance and fix security vulnerabilities following OWASP guidelines. |
| [`aidd-dev:08:debug`](../plugins/aidd-dev/skills/08-debug/README.md) | Reproduce and fix bugs systematically using test-driven workflow, root cause analysis, and hypothesis validation. |
| [`aidd-dev:09:for-sure`](../plugins/aidd-dev/skills/09-for-sure/README.md) | Iterative agent loop that tracks attempts and retries until a success condition is met. Use when the user says "for sure", "make sure", "keep trying until", "loop until done", "don't stop until", or needs guaranteed completion of a task with explicit success criteria. |

| [`aidd-vcs:03:release-tag`](../plugins/aidd-vcs/skills/03-release-tag/README.md) | Cut a semver release with annotated tag and release notes. Use when the user says "release", "tag", "tag this release", "bump version", "release v1.2.0", "cut a release", or invokes `/release-tag`. Do NOT use for plain commits without a tag, opening pull requests, pushing a branch only, or amending existing tags. |
| [`aidd-vcs:04:issue-create`](../plugins/aidd-vcs/skills/04-issue-create/README.md) | Create an issue in the configured ticketing tool.

## aidd-orchestrator

Orchestration plugin for the AI-Driven Development framework.

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|

Use when the user runs "/setup async dev", "configure async dev", "install async-dev plugin", or asks to set up Claude auto-implementation on issues. Do NOT use for running the async pipeline (use the run skill) or handling PR review loops (use the review skill). |
| [`aidd-orchestrator:02:run-async-dev`](../plugins/aidd-orchestrator/skills/02-run-async-dev/README.md) | Runs one async development pipeline cycle: polls issues labeled with the `to-implement` label (or its mention equivalent), resolves dependencies, locks the issue with `claude/working`, delegates implementation to whichever SDLC capability is loaded at runtime, verifies the outcome against the real state of git and the VCS host, and writes a `run-result.json` artifact for the workflow's post-job to finalize lifecycle effects. Use when a fresh issue is labeled or mentioned for implementation, or when the user says "run async dev", "implement ready issues", "process the async queue". Do NOT use for setup or for handling change-request review comment loops; other skills in this plugin cover those. |
| [`aidd-orchestrator:03:review-async-dev`](../plugins/aidd-orchestrator/skills/03-review-async-dev/README.md) | Handles the post-PR review-fix loop for runs created by this plugin's run skill. Triggered when the human labels the linked issue with `to-review` (or comments `@claude /review` on the PR). Collects review comments, decides whether to keep iterating, delegates fixes to whichever SDLC capability is loaded at runtime, replies to each addressed comment, resolves the threads, and posts a structured summary when stop conditions trigger. Use when the user (or a webhook / cron) says "handle review comments", "iterate on PR <n>", "address review feedback automatically", or invokes this skill on a specific PR. Do NOT use for the initial implementation or for setup; other skills in this plugin cover those. |

| [`aidd-refine:02:challenge`](../plugins/aidd-refine/skills/02-challenge/README.md) | Rethink prior work to verify correctness against an agreed plan, classifying findings as deal-breakers, suggestions, or correct, with a confidence score. Use when the user says "challenge this", "rethink your plan", "is this correct", "review my last decision", "challenge my decision", "challenge what you did", "is my decision right", "criticize this", "find flaws", or asks for a critical review of just-completed work. Do NOT use for line-by-line code review against a style guide, implementing features, writing tests, or generating new code. |
| [`aidd-refine:03:condense`](../plugins/aidd-refine/skills/03-condense/README.md) | Toggle terse output mode with intensity levels (lite, full, ultra) so prose drops articles, filler, and pleasantries while code, quoted errors, and security warnings stay verbatim. Also reports real token usage and estimated savings under condense mode for the current session. Use when the user says "condense", "condense output", "be more concise", "shorter answers", "tighten output", "/condense", "/condense full", "/condense ultra", "stop condense", "normal mode", "/condense-stats", "how much have we saved", or "token savings".
