## Anatomy of a plugin

Every plugin under `plugins/<plugin>/` follows the same shape:

```
plugins/<plugin>/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json        # manifest (name, version, description, skills[], $schema)
├── README.md              # human-facing landing page
├── CATALOG.md             # per-plugin auto-generated index
├── CHANGELOG.md           # release-please-managed
├── skills/                # router-based skills
│   └── <NN>-<name>/
│       ├── SKILL.md        # contract (name, description, actions table)
│       ├── README.md       # human-facing skill landing
│       ├── actions/        # atomic actions invoked by the router
│       ├── assets/         # templates and static files
│       ├── references/     # extended docs the skill links into
│       └── evals/          # scenario fixtures
├── agents/                 # named AI agents          (optional)
├── commands/               # slash commands           (optional)
├── hooks/hooks.json        # lifecycle hooks          (optional)
├── rules/                  # coding rules             (optional)
└── .mcp.json               # MCP server configuration (optional)
```

A plugin bundles **any subset** of the Claude Code surfaces (skills, agents, commands, hooks, rules, MCP servers); only `skills/` and the manifest are universal. Browse the [plugins](../plugins/) to see which surfaces each one ships.

The `plugin.json` is validated against [`claude-code-plugin-manifest`](https://www.schemastore.org/claude-code-plugin-manifest.json) by the `lefthook` pre-commit hook (when the JSON-schema validator, `pipx`/`check-jsonschema`, is available); the same hook validates `marketplace.json` against [`claude-code-marketplace`](https://www.schemastore.org/claude-code-marketplace.json). The `validate` workflow re-runs the hooks on every push and PR.

## Skills are routers

A skill's `SKILL.md` is a manifest plus an actions table. Claude Code loads the SKILL.md when the skill is invoked; the body decides which action(s) to run.

```mermaid
---
title: skill router pattern
---
flowchart LR
  User["User: 'Use skill aidd-X:NN-name'"]
  Skill["SKILL.md (router)"]
  Action1["actions/01-step.md"]
  Action2["actions/02-step.md"]
  ActionN["actions/NN-step.md"]
  Out["Outputs: files, labels, PRs, audit logs"]

  User --> Skill
  Skill -->|"choose 1..N"| Action1
  Skill -->|"choose 1..N"| Action2
  Skill -->|"choose 1..N"| ActionN
  Action1 --> Out
  Action2 --> Out
  ActionN --> Out
```

Each action is a self-contained markdown file with inputs, outputs, depends-on, process steps, and a test checklist. Actions can call other skills via the `Skill` tool, so a skill discovers a capability it needs at runtime (by matching skill descriptions, never by hardcoded plugin name) and delegates to it.

## Cross-plugin orthogonality

Plugins do not reference each other by name. When skill A needs a capability owned by skill B, it discovers a candidate at runtime through description matching. This rule keeps the marketplace forkable, the plugins swappable, and the docs maintainable.

The rule is enforced both socially (PR template checklist) and mechanically (lefthook hooks could be extended to grep for cross-plugin literal references).
