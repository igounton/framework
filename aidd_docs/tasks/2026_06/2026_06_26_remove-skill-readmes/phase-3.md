# Instruction: Validate Catalogs, Distribution, And Checks

Part of [`plan.md`](./plan.md).

## Architecture projection

```txt
scripts/
  summarize-markdown.js        # may need symlink-aware catalog behavior
  validate-*.mjs
lefthook.yml                   # may need focused symlink assertion
.github/workflows/
  validate.yml                 # runs lefthook over all files
plugins/
  <plugin>/
    CATALOG.md                 # generated, deterministic
    README.md
    skills/<skill>/README.md -> SKILL.md
```

## Tasks to do

### `1)` Make cataloging symlink-aware where needed

> Ensure generated catalogs and docs do not misrepresent symlinked skill READMEs as unique source files.

1. Run catalog generation for every plugin and inspect how direct skill README symlinks appear.
2. If catalog rows are misleading or duplicate `SKILL.md` metadata through the symlink, update `scripts/summarize-markdown.js` to handle symlinked direct skill READMEs deliberately.
3. Preserve catalog coverage for nested asset/template README files, because those remain substantive files.

### `2)` Add or document focused validation

> Ensure future changes cannot reintroduce regular direct per-skill README files.

1. Prefer adding a lightweight repository check if it fits existing hook style; otherwise document the required focused command in the relevant generator validation.
2. The check must fail when any direct `plugins/<plugin>/skills/<skill>/README.md` is a regular file or points anywhere other than `SKILL.md`.
3. The check must not fail for nested asset/template README files.

### `3)` Validate repository and build-relevant surfaces

> Prove the change works with the repository's available checks and release packaging assumptions.

1. Run the same local check path CI uses.
2. Run focused symlink assertions across all direct skill README paths.
3. If practical in the environment, smoke-test the framework build command used by release packaging for at least one target; otherwise record why it was skipped.
4. Review `git diff --stat` and `git diff --check`.

## Acceptance criteria

| Task | Acceptance criteria |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | `plugins/*/CATALOG.md` files are deterministic after regeneration and do not depend on stale per-skill README contents. |
| 1 | Nested asset/template README entries still appear when catalog rules include them. |
| 2 | A repeatable validation path catches any direct skill README regular file or wrong symlink target. |
| 2 | The validation path excludes nested asset/template README files. |
| 3 | `pnpm exec lefthook run pre-commit --all-files --force` passes. |
| 3 | Focused symlink assertion passes for every direct skill README. |
| 3 | `git diff --check` passes, and any skipped build smoke test is justified in the implementation notes. |

## Validation commands

```sh
pnpm exec lefthook run pre-commit --all-files --force
while IFS= read -r f; do expected="$(cd "$(dirname "$f")" && pwd -P)/SKILL.md"; test -L "$f" || { echo "not symlink: $f"; exit 1; }; target="$(readlink "$f")"; test "$target" = "SKILL.md" || { echo "bad target: $f -> $target"; exit 1; }; actual="$(cd "$(dirname "$f")" && realpath "$target")"; test "$actual" = "$expected" || { echo "bad resolution: $f -> $actual, expected $expected"; exit 1; }; done < <(find plugins -mindepth 4 -maxdepth 4 -path 'plugins/*/skills/*/README.md' -print | sort)
find plugins -mindepth 4 -maxdepth 4 -path 'plugins/*/skills/*/README.md' -type f -print | grep . && { echo "regular direct skill README remains"; exit 1; } || true
find plugins -mindepth 5 -path 'plugins/*/skills/*/README.md' -type f -print | sort
git diff --check
git diff --stat
npx --yes @ai-driven-dev/cli@4.6.1 framework build --source . --target codex --out "$(mktemp -d)" --flat
```

## Dependencies

- Phase 1 must provide the symlinked tree.
- Phase 2 must update generation/docs assumptions before final validation.

## Expected commit boundary

Commit after validation/catalog handling is complete and all checks have been run or explicitly documented as skipped.
