# Start a project (greenfield)

> **Goal:** Take a greenfield idea to a set-up project with its AIDD context, ready for the first feature.

|                   |                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Level**         | Beginner                       |
| **Time**          | ~30 min                        |
| **Prerequisites** | AIDD installed in your AI tool |

## Why

The greenfield sequence, at a glance — from a raw idea to a project the AIDD flow can build on.

> Prefer a guided walkthrough? `/aidd-context:00-onboard` inspects your project and routes you step by step instead of running the sequence by hand.

## Steps

1. 💡 **Brainstorm the idea**: `/aidd-refine:01-brainstorm` — sharpen the raw idea into a precise request.
2. 📄 **Draft the PRD**: `/aidd-pm:03-prd` — turn the idea into a structured product requirements document.
3. 🏗️ **Design the architecture**: `/aidd-context:01-bootstrap` — validate a stack through Q&A; outputs an `INSTALL.md`.
4. 🧠 **Build project memory**: `/aidd-context:02-project-memory` — create the memory bank and AI context files.
5. 🚀 **Ship the first feature**: follow [Ship a feature](ship-a-feature.md).

## Verify

- `aidd_docs/memory/` holds the memory files, and an `INSTALL.md` describes the chosen stack.

## Related

- [Ship a feature](ship-a-feature.md) — the per-feature loop once the project is set up.
- `/aidd-context:00-onboard` — re-run any time to see where the project sits.
